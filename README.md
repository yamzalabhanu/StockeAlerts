## 🆕 Latest Platform Updates

### 🎯 2-Day Price Projection Engine

StockeAlerts now includes a dedicated short-term projection layer that estimates the next 2-day directional bias and expected price range.

The projection engine evaluates:

- Current price and ATR-based expected movement
- RSI momentum
- ADX trend strength
- Relative volume participation
- Market regime context
- Multi-timeframe alignment
- AI chart-structure quality

Projection output includes:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `direction` | BULLISH, BEARISH, or SIDEWAYS |
| `confidence` | 50–95 confidence score |
| `projected_move_pct` | ATR-derived low/high move estimate |
| `expected_price_range` | Projected price range for the next move |
| `hold_guidance` | Continuation, downside-risk, or consolidation guidance |
| `risk` | LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH projection risk |

Example:

```text
Direction: BULLISH
Confidence: 82
Projected Move: 1.8% - 3.7%
Expected Range: 428.40 - 436.25
Guidance: Likely continuation for 2-4 days.
Risk: LOW
```

---

### 📚 Projection Learning

Projection results can be recorded and compared against actual future price movement.

The learning layer tracks:

- Projected direction
- Confidence score
- Expected move range
- Entry price
- Actual move percentage
- Whether the projected direction was correct
- Projection accuracy after enough samples

This creates a feedback loop for evaluating whether the projection engine is directionally useful over time.

---

### 🧠 Unified AI Reasoning Engine

A new reasoning layer combines market context, setup quality, chart structure, multi-timeframe alignment, execution quality, and historical setup performance into a single report.

The reasoning engine now produces:

- Final adjusted score
- A+/A/WATCH/REJECT decision
- Market regime classification
- Multi-timeframe structure result
- Execution-quality result
- Setup-quality result
- Chart-structure quality
- Reasons, warnings, and rejection notes
- Historical learning context
- Human-readable narrative summary

---

### 🌎 Market Regime Intelligence

Market-regime detection is now an active scoring layer instead of only a planned feature.

Supported regimes include:

- `TRENDING_BULL`
- `TRENDING_BEAR`
- `CHOPPY`
- `HIGH_VOL`
- `LOW_VOL`
- `MIXED`

The engine uses ETF breadth, bias, ADX, VIX, and ATR expansion when available. Trending regimes can boost aligned breakout/momentum/retest setups, while choppy or high-volatility regimes tighten filtering and penalize low-quality chase trades.

---

### ⚡ Execution Quality Layer

Before a setup is promoted, the system can evaluate execution risk using liquidity and movement-quality inputs such as:

- Spread quality
- Relative volume
- Dollar volume
- ATR percentage
- Slippage risk
- Late breakout risk
- VWAP/EMA extension

Poor liquidity or poor execution quality can reduce scores or reject otherwise strong-looking setups.

---

### 🧱 Smart Money Concepts (SMC) Confirmation

StockeAlerts includes an optional Smart Money Concepts confirmation module for directional setups.

It checks for:

- Liquidity sweeps
- Fair value gaps
- Order-block zones
- VWAP/EMA directional alignment
- Volume imbalance

A setup is approved only when the SMC score is strong enough and structure aligns with the selected direction.

---

### 📈 Options Contract Selection + Theta Control

Options support has been expanded with a Polygon snapshot-based selector that can identify liquid near-the-money contracts.

The options layer evaluates:

- Expiration / DTE
- Strike proximity
- Bid / ask / mid
- Spread percentage
- Delta
- Theta
- Implied volatility
- Volume and open interest

The true options flow and liquidity engine can also use Polygon/Massive-compatible options APIs to score explosive intraday and swing conditions:

- Aggressive call / put sweeps and large block-print proxies
- Put and call OI walls
- Fresh OI-build pressure via volume/open-interest ratios
- Dealer gamma state and gamma-squeeze conditions
- IV expansion proxies
- Delta imbalance and call/put premium imbalance

Set `OPTIONS_API_KEY`, `MASSIVE_API_KEY`, or `POLYGON_API_KEY` to enable the flow scan. Optional controls include `OPTIONS_API_BASE_URL`, `OPTIONS_FLOW_EXPIRY_DAYS`, `OPTIONS_SWEEP_NOTIONAL_THRESHOLD`, `OPTIONS_PUT_WALL_OI_THRESHOLD`, and `OPTIONS_GAMMA_SQUEEZE_MIN_SCORE`.

Theta risk control can recommend trimming or exiting contracts when decay risk becomes elevated.

---

### 🧭 Trade Management AI

Open-trade management now evaluates whether to hold, trim, tighten stops, or exit based on trend and follow-through quality.

Inputs include:

- ADX trend strength
- Relative volume
- Market regime
- Multi-timeframe trend
- Candle follow-through
- Momentum reversal risk
- VWAP extension
- Unrealized R-multiple

---

### 📊 Daily Learning Report

The bot can generate a daily adaptive-learning report summarizing:

- Overall win rate
- Forecast accuracy
- Confidence adjustment
- Score adjustment
- Strongest setup structures
- Weak structures that should be penalized

This report helps the system prioritize setups with realized edge instead of only static technical rules.

---

# ⚡ Dual-Mode Trading Engine

StockeAlerts supports both intraday and swing workflows:

| Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|
| ⚡ Intraday | Same-day scalps using 5m / 15m structure |
| 📈 Swing Trading | Multi-day trend trades, typically 2–10 days |

## Multi-Timeframe Swing Confirmation

| Timeframe | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Weekly | Overall trend |
| Daily | Setup structure |
| 4H | Entry timing |

The engine penalizes conflicts such as:

```text
Weekly bullish
Daily bearish
4H weak
```

This helps reduce fake breakouts, countertrend trades, and low-quality swing entries.
